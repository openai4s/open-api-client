          type: string
        prompt:
          description: &completions_prompt_description |
            The prompt(s) to generate completions for, encoded as a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.

            Note that <|endoftext|> is the document separator that the model sees during training, so if a prompt is not specified the model will generate as if from the beginning of a new document.
          default: '<|endoftext|>'
          nullable: true
          oneOf:
            - type: string

        suffix:
          description:
            The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.
          default: null
          nullable: true
          type: string
          example: "test."
        max_tokens:
          type: integer
          minimum: 0
          default: 16
          example: 16
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_max_tokens_description |
            The maximum number of [tokens](/tokenizer) to generate in the completion.

            The token count of your prompt plus `max_tokens` cannot exceed the model's context length. Most models have a context length of 2048 tokens (except for the newest models, which support 4096).
        temperature:
          type: number
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 2
          default: 1
          example: 1
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_temperature_description |
            What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.

            We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.
        top_p:
          type: number
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 1
          default: 1
          example: 1
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_top_p_description |
            An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.

            We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.
        n:
          type: integer
          minimum: 1
          maximum: 128
          default: 1
          example: 1
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_completions_description |
            How many completions to generate for each prompt.

            **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.
        stream:
          description: >
            Whether to stream back partial progress. If set, tokens will be sent as data-only [server-sent events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events#Event_stream_format)
            as they become available, with the stream terminated by a `data: [DONE]` message.
          type: boolean
          nullable: true
          default: false
        logprobs: &completions_logprobs_configuration
          type: integer
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 5
          default: null
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_logprobs_description |
            Include the log probabilities on the `logprobs` most likely tokens, as well the chosen tokens. For example, if `logprobs` is 5, the API will return a list of the 5 most likely tokens. The API will always return the `logprob` of the sampled token, so there may be up to `logprobs+1` elements in the response.

            The maximum value for `logprobs` is 5. If you need more than this, please contact us through our [Help center](https://help.openai.com) and describe your use case.
        echo:
          type: boolean
          default: false
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_echo_description >
            Echo back the prompt in addition to the completion
        stop:
          description: &completions_stop_description >
            Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The returned text will not contain the stop sequence.
          default: null
          nullable: true
          oneOf:
            - type: string
              default: <|endoftext|>
              example: "\n"

        presence_penalty:
          type: number
          default: 0
          minimum: -2
          maximum: 2
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_presence_penalty_description |
            Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.

            [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)
        frequency_penalty:
          type: number
          default: 0
          minimum: -2
          maximum: 2
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_frequency_penalty_description |
            Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

            [See more information about frequency and presence penalties.](/docs/api-reference/parameter-details)
        best_of:
          type: integer
          default: 1
          minimum: 0
          maximum: 20
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_best_of_description |
            Generates `best_of` completions server-side and returns the "best" (the one with the highest log probability per token). Results cannot be streamed.

            When used with `n`, `best_of` controls the number of candidate completions and `n` specifies how many to return – `best_of` must be greater than `n`.

            **Note:** Because this parameter generates many completions, it can quickly consume your token quota. Use carefully and ensure that you have reasonable settings for `max_tokens` and `stop`.
        logit_bias: &completions_logit_bias
          type: object
          x-oaiTypeLabel: map
          default: null
          nullable: true
          description: &completions_logit_bias_description |
            Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

            Accepts a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) (which works for both GPT-2 and GPT-3) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

            As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.
